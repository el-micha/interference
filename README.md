# Interference

A WIP game where you mine resources, build industry to produce energy to power _fields_ with different effects. One field might make stone softer, another might power your machines from afar, a third one might reveal ore concentrations, another might disturb your enemies' buildings, but most importantly: All fields interfere with each other in complex ways...

A player character with a pickaxe and lantern. The player is targeting a block of rock to the left, mining it with a click. The cave floor on the right reveals some coal veins in the ground. The silver laced tiles are ore bearing rocks.

The player has mined some space and revealed ore veins in the ground. Ore and coal veins in the ground are accessible and usable for buildings, which are build on top of such tiles. To the right of the player character, a _Coal Drill_ building has been placed. It can pass its products to adjacent buildings.

The player's field of view is limited in a radius around the player character. The viewing radius, the player's mining speed and other parameters can be manipulated by buildings that produce fields. As a prototype, the _Energy Dissipator_ building increases both mining speed and viewing radius, as long as it receives coal from an adjacent building. 

More to come.
